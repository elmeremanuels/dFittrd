# @curtain/garment-viewer

The overlay's optional **3D estimate** (docs/ENGINE-HANDOFF.md §On-device fitting, D16): an approved
garment bundle draped on a model built from the shopper's own girths, rendered with three.js, all
on the device.

```ts
const { mountGarmentView } = await import('@curtain/garment-viewer'); // only after the shopper's click
const view = await mountGarmentView(canvas, { baseUrl: asset.baseUrl, garment, fit, size, body: { bust, waist, hip } });
view.setSize('L');
view.dispose();
```

- **Rule 4 / D15:** it takes the embed's own `FitResult` (`anchorGaps(fit, size)`) and never computes a fit.
- **D3:** the only network traffic is GETs of the five bundle files under `baseUrl`; measurements stay in memory.
- **Rule 3:** the host labels the view an estimate (`apps/web/src/embed/Garment3D.tsx`).
- WebGL2 only (`GarmentViewError('unsupported')`), drapes in module workers (`drape.worker.ts`), main
  thread fallback. Before it drapes, `checkBundle` repeats the api's check (format, QA, every size
  of the live chart graded); a failure is `GarmentViewError('incompatible')`, and the overlay keeps
  the 2D figure.

Consumed as TypeScript source (`exports: "./src/index.ts"`) so the host's Vite emits the worker
correctly. apps/web puts it in the lazy `garment-viewer` chunk (three + this package, about 150 KB
gzip; budget 400 KB, `apps/web/scripts/check-viewer-chunk.mjs`), outside the Workbox precache.

## Fork of the spike

`src/core/*` (`garment`, `grading`, `waistband`, `tape`, `weld`, `types`) and the device modules
in `src/` (`bundle`, `body`, `fitting`, `engine`, `cloth`, `collide`, `drapeJob`, `drapePool`,
`drape.worker`, `scene` without Line2/outlines) are copied from `spikes/garment-engine`, which is
left untouched. `test/parity.test.ts` checks the fork against the spike (chains, grading of every
size, top edge, weld) on the synthetic `aalter-studio-2` bundle; the tests copied from the spike
(`cloth`, `engine`, `fitting`) still pass. Deduplicate when the spike is promoted.
